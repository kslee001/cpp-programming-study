data structure, algorithm and problem solving

### goal : 
1. algorithm 별로 general하게 적용될 수 있는 tamplate 만들기
2. 문제 접근 및 이해 훈련


### Steps to solve problems
1. Read and __understand__ the problem
2. __Redefine__ the problem
    break the problem into small pieces (_abstraction_)
3. Create solution plan (select algorithm and data stucture
4. Carry out the plan (_implement_ codes)
    __Complete one step__ before moving on another step

#### After solving problems
1. Prove the plan
    Check time complexity and memory usage
2. Look back on the plan and find a better way to improve it
